[AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) is a learning conference hosted by [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) for the global cloud computing community. The event features keynote announcements, training , certification opportunities and more than 1,000 technical sessions. This year, [Radiant Solutions](http://www.radiantsolutions.com/) was provided the opportunity to give one of those technical sessions on gathering machine learning training data for satellite imagery. We were asked to give a tech talk on how we use [Amazon's Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) to gather massive amounts of training data at scale and of high quality. In this talk we discuss our crowdsourcing platform, [Tomnod](https://www.tomnod.com/), which we use as a platform for Mechanical Turk workers to come and label our satellite imagery. 

Below is a video recording of the talk I gave at the conference. Although the talk was held at 8:30am, it was well attended and many questions were asked during Q&A. Our main takeaway from this is that the field of work we are in is very interesting and valuable to many conference attendees.
