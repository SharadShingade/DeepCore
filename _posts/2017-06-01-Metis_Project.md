Last year, I completed the Metis Data Science Bootcamp.  After 6 frustrating months looking for a job, I realized that my skills were outdated and I needed to go back to school.  I looked into my options: coding bootcamps, graduate school, online graduate programs, and decided that a coding bootcamp was the fastest and most economical way to polish my job skills.

Up until Metis, I had used Matlab as my main programming language for my entire professional career.  I had worked as a data scientist and ML engineer before, but always in Matlab.  At Metis, I learned about Python tools for data science, and I learned about how to present my work effetively.

The Metis curriculum is built around 5 student projects.  The projects are self-directed and include a lot of leeway to decide what problem you want to work on and how to want to approach it.  You gather your own data, process it yourself, and pick your own strategy for building a model.  Each project focuses ona  topic area like Regression, Classification, and Natural Language Processing.  Then there is a big final project, which is open to whatever you want to work on.  Recently Metis started a program to partner with companies to provide data for the final project.  With my connection to Metis, we decided to be the first company to partner with Metis on a data project.  This post will cover the structure of the project, and how we are supporting it.

I'll run through an example showing how to train a neural net to detect forests in Paris (yes, there are forests in Paris).  This is somewhat similar to the Kaggle competition being run by Planet.  The difference is that our goal is to have the student work out the *entire* project pipeline from data acquisition to results.  So we aren't just handing over a dataset with images and ground-truth; we're handing over a set of tools to help students acquire their own ground-truth.  Each student will choose their own project, and we're hoping that they will come up with lots of interesting ideas.
