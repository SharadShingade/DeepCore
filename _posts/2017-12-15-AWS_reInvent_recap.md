[AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) is a learning conference hosted by [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) for the global cloud computing community. The event features keynote announcements, training, certification opportunities and more than 1,000 technical sessions. This year, [Radiant Solutions](http://www.radiantsolutions.com/) was provided the opportunity to give one of those technical sessions on gathering machine learning training data for satellite imagery. I gave a tech talk on how we use [Amazon's Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) to gather massive amounts of high quality training data at scale. I described how we have Mechanical Turk workers use our crowdsourcing platform [Tomnod](https://www.tomnod.com/) to label [DigitalGlobe's] (https://www.digitalglobe.com) satellite imagery. 

Below is a video recording of the talk at re:Invent. Even with an 8:30 a.m. start time, it was well attended and many questions were asked during Q&A. Our main takeaway from this is that the field of work we are in is very interesting and valuable to many conference attendees.

Thanks for watching,
