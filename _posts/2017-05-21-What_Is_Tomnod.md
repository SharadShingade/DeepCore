# What is Tomnod?

Tomnod, taking its name from the Mongolian word for “big eye”, is a crowdsourcing application, where users look at imagery, and either tag features, or validate the presence of features, in a given image. It has been called a “virtual search party”.

One of the most prominent use cases for Tomnod was during the disappearance of the Malaysian Aircraft flight 229, where DigitalGlobe’s Tomnod site had over six million views on its Tomnod imagery, as users were busy tagging anything relevant to signs of life from a crash.

Currently, there’s a campaign up looking for Weddell seals in Antarctica. Check out [tomnod.com](http://www.tomnod.com) and get on it!

Next up, we’ll be talking about how Tomnod can be used with DigitalGlobe’s machine learning software to create an even more powerful workflow.
