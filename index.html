                            <p>DeepCore is a utility toolkit, written in modern C++ (C++11) by
                                <a href="http://www.digitalglobe.com">DigitalGlobe</a></p>

                        <p>It allows a user to download, perform either image classification or object detection, and
                            manipulate geospatial vector files. DeepCore is intended to be a machine learning
                            framework agnostic toolkit, allowing for a simple, clean, consistent programmatic interface.
                            It also
                            provides easy access to the DigitalGlobe imagery archive. As new
                            machine learning techniques and frameworks emerge, they can easily be integrated into
                            DeepCore. This
                            allows developers using DeepCore to easily extend their applications with the latest
                            technology, without
                            having to worry about the complexities of each framework or technique</p>

                        <p>DeepCore's machine learning features can also be accelerated by the use of Nvidia Graphics
                            Processing
                            Units (GPUs) using <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit">CUDA</a> technology.
                            By enabling
                            GPU mode, the process of object detection becomes very quick, allowing for faster and more
                            efficient
                            processing of large geographic areas. The use of GPUs to accelerate machine learning and
                            object
                            detection processes is highly recommended.</p>

            <h2>DeepCore Design and API</h2>
            <p>DeepCore is split into libraries that are grouped by function. This decoupled approach allows the
                application developer to use the pieces necessary for their needs, and no more. For more information on
                DeepCore, it's architecture and uses, please visit the <a href="deepcore.html">DeepCore Architecture

            <h2>Sample Application - gbdxm</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://github.com/DigitalGlobe/gbdxm">GBDXM packaging tool</a> is a DeepCore based
                executable that enables the user to package a machine learning model for use with other DeepCore based
                tools. It takes in a supported model format as an input, packages the model files into a single
                easy-to-use, easy-to-share container. The DeepCore framework can then use that model package to perform
                machine learning and object detection tasks. Currently, only Caffe models are supported, but other model
                formats are forthcoming as additional machine learning frameworks are incorporated into DeepCore.
            <p>A sample model can be downloaded from the Sample Download links at the top of the page or in the footer
                of the page.</p>

            <h2>Sample Application - OpenSpaceNet</h2>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/DigitalGlobe/OpenSpaceNet">OpenSpaceNet</a> is a DeepCore-based sample
                application that uses DigitalGlobe satellite imagery as an input source for the object detection. Using
                DigitalGlobe image services, such as the <a href="https://developer.digitalglobe.com/maps-api/">DigitalGlobe
                    Maps API</a> or the <a href="https://services.digitalglobe.com">My DigitalGlobe</a> imagery service,
                the user can access current satellite imagery for use in machine learning. OpenSpaceNet allows the user
                to select an area for detection, specify a model to use during detection, and get the results back in a
                geospatial format suitable for use in a GIS application or service.
             <p>To use the OpenSpaceNet application, please download the sample image and model provided on this page.
                They can be downloaded via the Sample Data links at the top and bottom of the page.</p>
